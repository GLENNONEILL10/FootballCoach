#FootballCoach ‚öΩ

A Flask-based web application that allows football (soccer) players to input match performance statistics by position (Striker, Winger, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper) and receive detailed feedback based on calculated metrics. Users can optionally create an account to save and revisit their performance history.








‚ú® Features

Position-Specific Input Forms: Dynamic forms tailored to each on-field position.

Real-Time Feedback: Calculate key performance statistics (e.g., passing accuracy, shot conversion, save percentage) and generate actionable feedback.

User Authentication: Register and log in to save performance entries.

Performance History: Authenticated users can view past entries by position, with combined averages and aggregated feedback.

Responsive Design: Clean, modern UI with CSS, supporting desktop and mobile devices.

üì¶ Technologies

Backend: Python, Flask, Flask-Login, Flask-SQLAlchemy

Database: SQLite (via SQLAlchemy ORM)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Jinja2 templates

Security: Password hashing with Werkzeug
